## ToDos
<a name='intro'></a>

1. Train a supervised learning model on simple 2D data 
   1. Model: Linear, Quadratic & Cubic
   2. Plot Loss over training cycle
   3. Compute Bias & Variance
   4. Experiments:
      1. Impact of model class on overfit, underfit
      2. Impact of training size on error, overfit, underfit
      3. How does k-fold Cross Validation helps in reducing the test error ?
      4. Does k-fold Cross Validation lead to overfitting ?
      5. Research: How overfitting can handled better ?  
2. Implement GD & SGD algorithm on simple 1D/2D problem
   1. Compare the time complexity of both methods.
      1. Plot a 2D plot of how each method approaches the optimal point. 
   2. How step size impacts the computation speed/result ?
   3. Does normalization help ? 
3. Implement a Linear Classifier for 2D example
   1. Data set
      1. Linearly separable
      2. Not linearly separable
   2. Find the margin of classifier
   3. With/o bias term 
   4. Experiment with Loss functions 
      1. 1/0 Loss
      2. Squared Loss
      3. What are problems with each ?
      4. Perceptron Loss
